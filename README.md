### Memory Management
This assignment is about OS virtual memory management. Although, typically, an OS can support more than one process, this assignment assumes there is only one process. The assignment is to simulate memory management (specifically memory address mapping), where we assume a tiny computing system that supports up to 1KB of physical memory with 12-bit virtual addresses (4096 bytes). Suppose that the size of a virtual page and a physical frame is 128 bytes (i.e., with 7 address bits representing page offset). Write a Java program called OS1Assignment.java. This program will take only one parameter − the input sequence filename, which contains a sequence of virtual memory accesses − where each address is stored as 8 bytes (unsigned long type). Your program should read and analyse each virtual address (in binary format) and translate it into the corresponding physical address (in binary format) based on the given page table

The code was edited to make sure that the carbon atoms and hydrogen atoms match and that no extra atoms are left not bonded. This is done by making sure that the factors for hydrogen and carbon are the same
